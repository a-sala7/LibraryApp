# LibraryApp
A library management WinForms application that interfaces with a MSSQL Server database via SqlClient

This project was made for the HCI and Database courses that I had in the first semester of my 2nd year in college :)  
Its some of my earliest work so its not the best but I had a blast making it! That semester was definitely the best and most one in all 4 years.  

Check out the documentation! The PDF file `Library App Documentation.pdf` is included in the root folder.
